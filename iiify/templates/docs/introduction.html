  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  
  <p><a href="https://iiif.io">IIIF</a> is an initialism that stands for the International Image Interoperability Framework.</p>

  <p>
    This introduction describes the way that the IIIF standards have been applied to the Internet Archive's services.
  </p>

    <h2><a name="intro-iiif">What is IIIF?</a></h2>
    <p>
      IIIF is a set of open standards for delivering high-quality, attributed digital objects online at scale. Itâ€™s also an international community developing and implementing the IIIF APIs in various contexts. IIIF is backed by a consortium of leading cultural institutions. For more details and examples, check out the <a href="https://iiif.io">IIIF website</a>, or the <a href="https://iiif.io/api">full API specifications</a>.
    </p>
    <p>For a very high-level overview see <a href="https://iiif.io/get-started/how-iiif-works/">"How IIIF Works"</a> published by the IIIF Consortium.</p>

    <h2><a name="intro-importance">Importance</a></h2>
    <p>
      In essence, the goal of IIIF is interoperability: to make an
      institution's image and audio/visual openly accessible resources available and easily reusable in a variety of web viewers and players without the need for any special plugins or software.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Internet Archive IIIF API is
      a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">RESTful</a> 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service">web
  service</a> which implements the IIIF API specifications 
      and provides a mechanism for accessing nearly all of the Archive's
      items in IIIF format. Every image item in the Archive
      now has has a corresponding info.json and nearly all image, text, audio and movie items have an associated
      manifest.json file. This means you can seamlessly view any Archive.org
      image or book in any compatible IIIF viewer and also enjoy
      the enhancements they provide (annotation, side-by-size viewing,
      and loading images from different institutions into the same
      space).
    </p>

    <p>
      The service also provides a mechanism for producing permanantly
      citeable image tiles of any arbitrary region of any image or book
      found in the Internet Archive.
    </p>

    <h3>Image API</h3>
    <p>
      The <a href="http://iiif.io/api/image/">Image API</a> is an
      interface capable of producing and serving arbitrary tiles of
      arbitrary regions of an image (just like the different scales of resolution in Google Maps). The properties
      of these image tiles are specified within a URL, allowing
      permenant citation and retrieval at a later time.
      The Image API supports and powers other computer applications
      (like <a href="https://universalviewer.io/">deep-zoomable image
	viewers</a>, <a href="https://projectmirador.org/">comparison viewers</a>, and <a href="https://iiif.io/get-started/iiif-viewers/">more</a>).
    </p>

    <p>The Image API creates images using the following template: </p>
      <div class="request">{scheme}://{server}{/prefix}/{identifier}/{region}/{size}/{rotation}/{quality}.{format}</div>
    <p>In the context of the Internet Archive items, that will look like this for a full image:</p>
    <div class="request">https://iiif.archive.org/image/<b>:id+filename</b>/full/max/0/default.jpg</div>

    <p>A request for a bitonal center-cropped square image 375 pixels on each side, rotated 45 degrees will look like this:</p>
    <div class="request">https://iiif.archive.org/image/<b>:id+filename</b>/square/375,/45/bitonal.jpg</div>

<p>For more details on the options for constructing image requests via URL parameters, see the full <a href="https://iiif.io/api/image/3.0/#4-image-requests">IIIF Image API specifications.</a></p>

    <h3>Presentation API</h3>
    <p>
      The <a href="http://iiif.io/api/presentation/">Presentation
	API</a> allows institutions to publish and consume metadata about
      collections and sequences of digital objects, called "manifests." For images and texts, this is almost always used in conjunction with the IIIF Image API to create manifests for digital objects that any IIIF viewer can use to present an engaging deep-zoom experience.</p>

      <p>The Presentation API can also faciliate the portability and playback of time-based media like audio and video files. In the A/V context, IIIF manifests often present multiple playback options based on the media formats and quality types available.</p>
      
      <p>A manifest for an Internet Archive items look like this:</p>
    <div class="request">https://iiif.archive.org/iiif/<b>:id</b>/manifest.json</div>
