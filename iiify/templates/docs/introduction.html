  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>
    For those newly aquainted with IIIF, this
    introduction describes the purpose and applications of
    <a href="https://iiif.io">IIIF</a> and the Internet Archive's IIIF
    Service.
  </p>

  <section>
    <h2><a name="intro-iiif">What is IIIF?</a></h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://iiif.io">IIIF</a> (the "International Image
      Interoperability Framework") is a set of open standards for delivering high-quality, attributed digital objects online at scale. Itâ€™s also an international community developing and implementing the IIIF APIs. IIIF is backed by a consortium of leading cultural institutions. For more details and examples, check out the <a href="https://iiif.io">IIIF website</a>, or the <a href="https://iiif.io/api">full API specifications</a>.
    </p>
    <p>For a very high-level overview, see <a href="https://iiif.io/get-started/how-iiif-works/">"How IIIF Works,"</a> published by the IIIF Consortium.</p>

    <h3>Image API</h3>
    <p>
      The <a href="http://iiif.io/api/image/">Image API</a> is an
      interface capable of producing and serving arbitrary tiles of
      arbitrary regions of an image (just like the different scales of resolution in Google Maps). The properties
      of these image tiles are specified within a URL, allowing
      permenant citation and retrieval at a later time.
      The Image API supports and powers other computer applications
      (like <a href="https://universalviewer.io/">deep-zoomable image
	viewers</a>, <a href="https://projectmirador.org/">comparison viewers</a>, and <a href="https://iiif.io/get-started/iiif-viewers/">more</a> .
    </p>

    <h3>Presentation API</h3>
    <p>
      The <a href="http://iiif.io/api/presentation/">Presentation
	API</a> allows institutions to publish and consume metadata about
      collections and sequences of image resources, called Manifests.  A
      Manifest may be composed of resources from any number of different
      institutions serving their images in IIIF format.
    </p>
    
    <h2><a name="intro-importance">Importance</a></h2>
    <p>
      In essence, the goal of IIIF is interoperability: to make an
      institution's image and audio/visual openly accessible resources available and easily reusable via web
      applications and clients running on other domains.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Internet Archive IIIF API is
      a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">RESTful</a> 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service">web
	service</a> which implements the IIIF API specifications 
      API and provides a mechanism for accessing nearly all of the Archive's
      items IIIF format. Every image item in the Archive
      now has has a corresponding info.json and nearly all image, text, audio and movie item has
      manifest.json. This means, you can seamlessly view any Archive.org
      image or book in any compatible IIIF viewer and also enjoy
      the enhancements they provide (annotation, side-by-size viewing,
      and loading images from different institutions into the same
      space).
    </p>

    <p>
      The service also provides a mechanism for producing permanantly
      citeable image tiles of any arbitrary region of any image or book
      found in the Internet Archive.
